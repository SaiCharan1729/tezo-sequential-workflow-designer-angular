This package contains a extendable data model of a sequential workflow.

## ðŸ”¨ How to Extend Model

To extend the model, you need to extend base interfaces.

```ts
interface MyDefinition extends Definition {
  properties: {
    baseUrl: string;
  };
}

interface SendEmailStep extends Step {
  componentType: 'task';
  type: 'sendEmail';
  properties: {
    to: string;
    subject: string;
    body: string;
  };
}

interface IfStep extends BranchedStep {
  componentType: 'switch';
  type: 'if';
  properties: {
    condition: string;
  };
}
```
